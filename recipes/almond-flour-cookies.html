    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These 3-ingredient vegan almond flour cookies are rich, shortbread-like, crisp on the edges, irresistibly chewy in the middle, and they just might be the easiest cookies you'll ever make! No refined-sugar, eggs, oil or gluten. Ready in 20 minutes! Allergy-friendly other than almonds.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups fine almond flour (170 g)</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon fine sea salt, optional</li>
        <li>¼ cup maple syrup</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (176 C), and line a baking sheet with parchment or silicone mat. Tip: during testing, my Silpat mat produced better texture, a more crisp cookie, as compared to parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl whisk together the almond flour and salt, if using. Add the maple syrup and vanilla, and stir until fully combined. The dough should look moist but still slightly crumbly and ragged.</li>
        <li>Scoop up one barely rounded tablespoon of dough per cookie (see photos in post for reference). Place on the cookie sheet about 2 ½ inches apart.</li>
        <li>Cut a small, cookie-sized square of parchment paper, and locate a flat-bottomed glass. Use the glass to flatten the cookies, with the parchment square in between to prevent sticking. The cookies should be about ¼ inch thick and 2 ½ inches in diameter. It's okay for the outer edges of the cookies to be somewhat jagged. This gives the cookies a lacy (yet rustic) look and those frilly parts get nice and crisp.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until the edges and bottoms are golden. If you suspect your oven runs hot, you may want to check on them sooner than 10 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet.</li>
    </ol>
